# Niche Construction Simulation
Repository for the course Natural Computing at Radboud University, Spring 2025. 


This repository contains the code base of a project which was executed for the course Natural Computing at the Radboud University. The project was executed by ,  and . The course itself was tutored by Prof. Dr. .

## Experiment and results
### 3. Competing Species with Distinct Niche Strategies

We introduce two distinct agent species of A (Environmental Enricher) and B (Aggressive Consumer) in this experiment. Each agent is equipped with predefined niche-construction behaviors. Specie A enrich the environment by promoting food growth, while specie B corrupts the environment through aggressive resource consumption. 

Objective: Explore the ecological and evolutionary dynamics arising from inter-species competition. Key outcomes include scenarios of coexistence, dominance by one species, or mutual extinction due to unsustainable strategies.
