# Niche Construction Simulation
Repository for the course Natural Computing at Radboud University, Spring 2025. 


This repository contains the code base of a project which was executed for the course Natural Computing at the Radboud University. The project was executed by ,  and . The course itself was tutored by Prof. Dr. .

## Experiment and results
### 1. Evolving Agents with Local Environmental Modification

 We implement agents equipped with behavior that allows them to modify their surroundings by planting food on local tiles, simulating a basic form of resource management. 

Objective: Assess how the ability to construct or modify niches influences long-term genetic diversity, speed of adaptation, and population stability.
